# üö® URGENT: Fix ladybugai.us API Calls

## The Problem
Your website `ladybugai.us` shows "API calls failed" when using the humanizer tool.

## The Cause
**Environment variables are NOT set in Vercel** (or deployment hasn't updated after adding them).

---

## ‚úÖ SOLUTION - Step by Step

### Step 1: Check Current Configuration

After Vercel redeploys (in ~2 minutes), visit:
```
https://ladybugai.us/api/test-config
```

This will show you which environment variables are missing.

**Expected Output (Good):**
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "message": "‚úÖ All environment variables are configured!"
}
```

**If You See Missing Config:**
```json
{
  "status": "missing_config",
  "message": "‚ùå Missing 6 required environment variable(s)",
  "missing": ["OPENAI_API_KEY", "SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY", ...]
}
```

---

### Step 2: Add Environment Variables to Vercel

**IMPORTANT:** You need to add them to Vercel's dashboard, not just your local `.env.local` file.

#### üîó Direct Link:
1. Go to: **https://vercel.com/dashboard**
2. Find your project (probably `ladybug-ai` or similar)
3. Click **Settings** ‚Üí **Environment Variables**

#### üìã Add These 9 Variables:

Open your local `.env.local` file and copy each value:

| Variable Name | Where to Get It |
|---------------|----------------|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` | From `.env.local` |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | From `.env.local` |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | From `.env.local` |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | From `.env.local` |
| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` | From `.env.local` |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | From `.env.local` |
| `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | From `.env.local` |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` | Set to `https://ladybugai.us` |
| `CRON_SECRET` | Any random string like `ladybug_2024_secret` |

#### ‚öôÔ∏è For Each Variable:
1. Click **"Add New"**
2. **Name**: Enter the variable name (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`)
3. **Value**: Paste the value from your `.env.local` file
4. **Environment**: Select **ALL THREE** ‚úÖ
   - ‚úÖ Production
   - ‚úÖ Preview
   - ‚úÖ Development
5. Click **"Save"**

**Repeat for all 9 variables!**

---

### Step 3: Redeploy

**CRITICAL:** Environment variables only work after redeployment!

1. In Vercel, go to **"Deployments"** tab
2. Find the latest deployment (at the top)
3. Click the **three dots (...)** menu
4. Click **"Redeploy"**
5. ‚úÖ Confirm the redeploy
6. ‚è≥ Wait 1-2 minutes

---

### Step 4: Verify the Fix

After redeployment completes:

#### Test 1: Check Configuration
Visit: `https://ladybugai.us/api/test-config`

**Expected:** All checks should be `true`

#### Test 2: Test the Humanizer
1. Go to: `https://ladybugai.us`
2. Scroll to "Try It Free" section
3. Enter test text: "This is AI generated text that needs humanization"
4. Click "Humanize Text"
5. ‚úÖ Should work in 2-3 seconds!

---

## üêõ If Still Not Working

### Check 1: Environment Variables Added?

In Vercel dashboard ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables:
- Count how many variables you see
- Should be **9 total**
- Each should show all 3 environments (Production, Preview, Development)

### Check 2: Redeployed After Adding?

- Go to Deployments tab
- Check timestamp of latest deployment
- Must be AFTER you added the environment variables
- If not, redeploy again!

### Check 3: Check Browser Console

1. Go to `ladybugai.us`
2. Press **F12** (or Cmd+Option+I on Mac)
3. Go to **Console** tab
4. Try the humanizer again
5. Look for error messages (screenshot and send to me)

### Check 4: Vercel Function Logs

1. In Vercel ‚Üí **Deployments**
2. Click on your live deployment
3. Click **"Functions"** tab
4. Find `/api/humanize`
5. Look for red error messages
6. Common errors:
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY is not defined` ‚Üí Variable not added or not redeployed
   - `401 Unauthorized` ‚Üí OpenAI key is invalid
   - `Cannot connect to Supabase` ‚Üí Supabase keys not added

## üì∏ Screenshots to Take (If Still Failing)

If it's still not working after following all steps, take these screenshots:

1. **Vercel Environment Variables page** (showing all 9 variables - blur the values!)
2. **Vercel Deployments page** (showing latest deployment time)
3. **Browser console** when you click "Humanize Text"
4. **The output of** `https://ladybugai.us/api/test-config`

## ‚ö° Quick Checklist

Before asking for help, verify:

- [ ] Opened Vercel dashboard
- [ ] Found my project settings
- [ ] Added all 9 environment variables
- [ ] Selected all 3 environments for each variable
- [ ] Clicked "Save" for each variable
- [ ] Went to Deployments tab
- [ ] Clicked "Redeploy" on latest deployment
- [ ] Waited for deployment to complete (green checkmark)

## üí° Common Mistakes

### ‚ùå Mistake 1: Added vars but didn't redeploy
**Fix:** You MUST redeploy for vars to take effect!

### ‚ùå Mistake 2: Only selected "Production" environment
**Fix:** Select all 3 environments (Production, Preview, Development)

### ‚ùå Mistake 3: Typo in variable name
**Fix:** Variable names are case-sensitive! Copy exactly: `OPENAI_API_KEY` not `openai_api_key`

### ‚ùå Mistake 4: Wrong API key format
**Fix:** OpenAI key should start with `sk-proj-` or `sk-`

### ‚ùå Mistake 5: Old deployment still cached
**Fix:** Hard refresh browser (Cmd+Shift+R or Ctrl+Shift+R)

---

## üéØ Expected Timeline

- **Add env vars:** 5 minutes
- **Redeploy:** 2 minutes
- **Test:** 1 minute
- **Total:** ~10 minutes
